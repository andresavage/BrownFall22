# More EDA

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_theme(palette='colorblind')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
arabica_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/arabica_data_cleaned.csv'
robusta_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(arabica_data_url,index_col=0)
```

## Which of the following is distributed most similarly to Sweetness?

```{code-cell} ipython3
scores_of_interest = ['Flavor','Balance','Aroma','Body',
                      'Uniformity','Aftertaste','Sweetness']
```

We can answer this statistically, technically, but it will be easiest to do this
looking ad a plot.

First step is to subset the data:

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[scores_of_interest].head(2)
```

Then we produce a kde plot

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[scores_of_interest].plot(kind='kde')
```

We could also do it with seaborn

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=coffee_df[scores_of_interest])
```

the default is not as helpful as using

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=coffee_df[scores_of_interest],kind='kde')
```

If we forget the parameter `kind`, we get its default value.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

print('\n'.join(sns.displot.__doc__.split('\n')[5:10]))
```

## Summarizing with multiple variables

So, we can summarize data now, but the summaries we have done so far have treated each variable one at a time.  The most interesting patterns are in often in how multiple variables interact. We'll do some modeling that looks at multivariate functions of data in a few weeks, but for now, we do a little more with summary statistics.

On Monday, we saw how to see how many reviews there were per country, using

```{code-cell} ipython3
total_per_country = coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
```

What just happened?
![split-apply-combine image showing one data table, it split into 3 part, the sum applied to each part, and the sums combined back into one table](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/figures/03.08-split-apply-combine.png)

Groupby splits the whole dataframe into parts where each part has the same value for `Country.of.Origin` and then after that, we extracted the `Number.of.Bags` column, took the sum (within each separate group) and then put it all back together in one table (in this case, a `Series` becuase we picked one variable out)

### How does Groupby Work?
```{important}
This is more details with code examples on how the groupby works.  If you want
to run this code for yourself, use the download icon at the top right to download
these notes as a notebook.
```

We can view this by saving the groupby object as a variable and exploring it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
country_grouped = coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')

country_grouped
```

Trying to look at it without applying additional functions, just tells us the type.  But, it's iterable, so we can loop over.

```{code-cell} ipython3
for country,df in country_grouped:
    print(type(country), type(df))
```

````{margin}
```{note}
I used this feature to build the separate view of the communication channels on this website.  You can view that source using the github icon on that page.
```
````

We could manually compute things using the data structure, if needed, though using pandas functionality will usually do what we want. For example:

````{margin}
```{note}
I tried putting this dictionary into the dataframe for display purposes using the regular constructor and got an error, so I googled about making one from a dictionary to get the docs, which is how I learned about the [`from_dict`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.from_dict.html) method and its `orient` parameter which solved my problems.
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_total_dict = {}

for country,df in country_grouped:
    tot_bags =  df['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
    bag_total_dict[country] = tot_bags

pd.DataFrame.from_dict(bag_total_dict, orient='index',
                           columns = ['Number.of.Bags.Sum'])
```

is the same as what we did before

## Sorting DataFrames

We saved the totals, so we can check what type that is.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(total_per_country)
```

It's a pandas series, so we can use the `sort_values` method.

````{margin}
```{admonition} Try it yourself
There is another sort method, `sort_index` what would that one do?
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
total_per_country.sort_values(ascending=False)
```

## More plot types

We can also look at the distributions

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='violin')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar')
```

````{margin}
```{note}
We can use `head(10)` here too.
```
````

+++

## How can we pick the top 10 countries out?

```{code-cell} ipython3
total_per_country.sort_values(ascending=False)[:10]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(total_per_country.sort_values(ascending=False)[:10])
```

this is a series, but we can change it to a DataFrame with `reset_index()` this will also add a new index column but a side effect is that it becomes a DataFrame again

```{code-cell} ipython3
top_total_df = total_per_country.sort_values(ascending=False)[:10].reset_index()
top_total_df
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=top_total_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect=2)
```

this got the number of countries fewer, bu they were still hard to read because they were small and still overlapping, so I added `aspect=2` to make it 2x as wide as tall and give it more space. We can also use a similar strategy to pull out just these country names and get all the data for those.

```{code-cell} ipython3
top_countries = total_per_country.sort_values(ascending=False)[:10].index
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].isin(top_countries)].head(2)
```

I forgot the `isin` method in class and had to look that up, I more often need to filter by numerical columns or selecting a single value.

```{code-cell} ipython3
top_coffee_df = coffee_df[coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].isin(top_countries)]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect=2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
top_coffee_df.info()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(top_coffee_df, x='Sweetness', kind='kde', col='Country.of.Origin',col_wrap=3)
```

We'll see next week how to manipulate the dataset so that we can plot multiple scores this way.

## General Plotting Ideas

There are lots of type of plots, we saw the basic patterns of how to use them and we've used a few types, but we cannot (and do not need to) go through every single type.  There are general patterns that you can use that will help you think about what type of plot you might want and help you understand them to be able to customize plots.  

[Seaborn's main goal is opinionated defaults and flexible customization](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html#opinionated-defaults-and-flexible-customization


### Anatomy of a figure

First is the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) structure of a figure.  BOth pandas and seaborn and other plotting libraries use matplotlib. Matplotlib was used [in visualizing the first Black hole](https://numfocus.org/case-studies/first-photograph-black-hole).

![annotated graph](https://matplotlib.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_anatomy_001.png)

This is a lot of information, but these are good to know things.  THe most important is the figure and the axes.

```{admonition} Try it Yourself
Make sure you can explain what is a figure and what are axes in your own words and why that distinction matters. Discuss in office hours if you are unsure.
```

*that image was [drawn with code](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html#anatomy-of-a-figure)* and that page explains more.


### Plotting Function types in Seaborn

Seaborn has two *levels* or groups of plotting functions. Figure and axes.  Figure level fucntions can plot with subplots.

![summary of plot types](https://seaborn.pydata.org/_images/function_overview_8_0.png)


This is from thie [overivew]() section of the official seaborn tutorial. It also includes a comparison of
[figure vs axes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/function_overview.html#relative-merits-of-figure-level-functions) plotting.

The [official introduction](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html) is also a good read.

### More

The [seaborn gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) and [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/gallery.html) are nice to look at too.

## Styling Plots

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.set_theme()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect=2)
```

This by default styles the plots to be more visually appealing

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.set_theme(palette='colorblind')
sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect=2)
```

the colorblind palette is more distinguishable under a variety fo colorblindness types. [for more](https://gist.github.com/mwaskom/b35f6ebc2d4b340b4f64a4e28e778486)

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.set_theme(palette='bright')
sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect=2)
```

Colorblind is a good default, but you can choose others that yo like more too.

[more on colors](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html#general-principles-for-using-color-in-plots)

+++

to prepare plots for posters vs printing, etc you can use:

```{code-cell} ipython3
with sns.plotting_context('paper'):
    sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect =2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
with sns.plotting_context('poster'):
    sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect =2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
with sns.plotting_context('talk'):
    sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect =2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
with sns.plotting_context('notebook'):
    sns.catplot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='bar',aspect =2)
```

It's not perfect, but it gives you a good starting point.

## More Practice

- Make a table thats total number of bags and mean and count of scored for each of the variables in the `scores_of_interest` list.
- Make a bar chart of the mean score for each variable `scores_of_interest` grouped by country.
