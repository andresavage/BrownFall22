# Cleaning Data: fixing values

So far, we've dealt with structural issues in data. but there's a lot more to
cleaning.  

Today,  we'll deal with how to fix the values within  the data.

Examples of how values can be represented poorly:

[Propublica Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) the "How we acquired data" section

```{hint}
 you can treat this one proejct as multiple cleaned datasets and study it more carefully for A4.

## Missing Values


Dealing with missing data is a whole research area. There isn't one solution.


[in 2020 there was a whole workshop on missing](https://artemiss-workshop.github.io/)

one organizer is the main developer of [sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) the ML package we will use soon.  In a [2020 invited talk](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/ray2020/08/Keynote-%20Easier%20Machine%20Learning%20Thoughts%20From%20Scikit-Learn%20-%20Ga%C3%ABl%20Varoquaux%2C%20Research%20Director%2C%20Inria.pdf) he listed more automatic handling as an active area of research  and a development goal for sklearn.

There are also many classic approaches both when training and when [applying models](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume8/saar-tsechansky07a/saar-tsechansky07a.pdf).


[example application in breast cancer detection](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.701.4234&rep=rep1&type=pdf)


Even in pandas, dealing with [missing values](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html) is under [experimentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html#missing-data-na)
 as to how to represent it symbolically


Missing values even causes the [datatypes to change](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html#missing-data-casting-rules-and-indexing)


That said, there are are om
Pandas gives a few basic tools:

- dropna
- fillna



Dropping is a good choice when you otherwise have a lot of data and the data is
missing at random.

Dropping can be risky if it's not missing at random. For example, if we saw in
the coffee data that one of the scores was missing for all of the rows from one
country, or even just missing more often in one country, that could bias our
results.  

Filling can be good if you know how to fill reasonably, but don't have data to
spare by dropping.  For example
- you can approximate with another column
- you can approximate with that column from other rows


**whatever you do, document it**

### Finding Missing Values

Our skill in summarixing and getting overviews of data helps us know when we
have a problem.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.info()
```

### Example Filling

The 'Lot.Number' has a lot of NaN values, how can we explore it?

We can look at the type:

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].dtype
```

And we can look at the value counts.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].value_counts()
```


We see that a lot are '1', maybe we know that when the data was collected, if the Farm only has one lot, some people recorded '1' and others left it as missing. So we could fill in with 1:

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].fillna(1).head(10)
```

Note that even after we called `fillna` we display it again and the original data is unchanged.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].head(3)
```


To save the filled in column we have a few choices:
- use the `inplace` parameter. This doesn't offer performance advantages, but does It still copies the object, but then reassigns the pointer. Its under discussion to [deprecate](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16529)
- write to a new DataFrame
- add a column


We'll use adding a column:
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['lot_number_clean'] = coffee_df['Lot.Number'].fillna('1')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['lot_number_clean'].value_counts()
```

### Example Dropping



To illustrate how `dropna` works, we'll use the `shape` method after each call.  
Dropna is going to drop either rows or columns. So we

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.shape
```

By default, it drops any row with one or more `NaN` values.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.dropna().shape
```

We could instead tell it to only drop rows with `NaN` in a subset of the columns.
We might do this if we were interested in studying the impact of altitude on the ratings .

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.dropna(subset=['altitude_low_meters']).shape
```

In the [Open Policing Project Data Summary](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) we saw that they made a summary information that showed which variables had at least 70% not missing values.  We can similarly choose to keep only variables that have more than a specific threshold of data, using the `thresh` parameter and `axis=1` to drop along columns.

The `thresh` parameter requires an `int` not a fraction of the rows, so we can
save the shape values to variables and then use that

```{code-cell} ipython3
nrows, ncols = coffee_df.shape
coffee_df.dropna(thresh =.7*nrows,axis=1).shape
```
This dataset is actually in pretty good shape, but if we use a more stringent threshold it drops more columns.
```{code-cell} ipython3
nrows, ncols = coffee_df.shape
coffee_df.dropna(thresh =.85*nrows,axis=1).shape
```

## Inconsistent values

This was one of the things that many of you anticipated or had observed.  A useful way to investigate for this, is to use `value_counts` and sort them alphabetically by the values from the original data, so that similar ones will be consecutive in the list. Once we have the `value_counts()` Series, the values from the `coffee_df` become the index, so we use `sort_index`.

Let's look at the `In.Country.Partner` column
```
coffee_df['In.Country.Partner'].value_counts().sort_index()
```
---
We can see there's only one `Blossom Valley International\n` but 58 `Blossom Valley International`, the former is likely a typo, especially since `\n` is a special character for a newline. Similarly, with 'Specialty Coffee Ass' and 'Specialty Coffee Association'.
---
This is another job for dictionaries, we make one with the value to replace as the key and the value to insert as the value.
```
partner_corrections = {'Blossom Valley International\n':'Blossom Valley International',
  'Specialty Coffee Ass':'Specialty Coffee Association'}
coffee_df['in_country_partner_clean'] = coffee_df['In.Country.Partner'].replace(
  to_replace=partner_corrections)
coffee_df['in_country_partner_clean'].value_counts().sort_index()
```


## Fixing data at load time

Some of the different parameters in `read_csv` can also fix how it reads in data.

For example `header` can make somethign like this:

![mulitindex img of excel file](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/BrownFall20/raw/main/img/multiindex.png)

read in correctly.  



## A Cleaning Data Recipe

__not everything possible, but good enough for this course__


1. Can you use parameters to read the data in better?
1. Fix the index and column headers (making these easier to use makes the rest easier)
1. Is the data strucutred well?
1. Are there missing values?
1. Do the datatypes match what you expect by looking at the head or a sample?
1. Are categorical variables represented in usable way?
1. Does your analysis require filtering or augmenting the data?

examples of cleaning data to see how these types of manipulations get used.

it reproducible.
