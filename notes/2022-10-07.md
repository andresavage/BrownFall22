# Getting Data from Databases

```{important}
Your first portfolio check is due October 17th
```


## What is a Database?


A common attitude in Data Science is:

> If your data fits in memory there is no advantage to putting it in a database: it will only be slower and more frustrating.     â€”[ Hadley Wickham](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dbplyr.html)


Businesses and research organizations nearly always have too much data to feasibly work without a database.
Instead, they use different tools which are designed to scale to very large amounts of data. These tools are largely databases like Snowflake or Google's BigQuery and distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark.


```{warning}
We are going to focus on the case of getting data out of a Database so that you
can use it and making sure you know what a Database is.  


You could spend a whole semester on databases:
- CSC436 covers how to implement them in detail (recommended, but requires CSC212)
- BAI456 only how to use them (counts for DS majors, but if you want to
      understand them deeper, the CSC one is recommended)

```

For the purpose of this class the key attributes of a database are:
- it is a collection of tables 


## Accessing a Database from Python

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
from urllib import request
import sqlite3
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
request.urlretrieve('https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/raw/main/data/nba1819.db',
   'nba1819.db')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
conn = sqlite3.connect('nba1819.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cursor.fetchall()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM teams",conn)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_sql(con=conn,sql="SELECT * FROM teams LIMIT 3")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM playerTeams2018 LIMIT 1",conn)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
p18 =pd.read_sql("SELECT PLAYER_ID FROM playerTeams2018 ",conn)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
p18.value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_sql("SELECT PLAYER_NAME FROM playerNames WHERE PLAYER_ID = 1629150",conn)
```

DId more player change conference or stay within when traded from 18 to 19

```{code-cell} ipython3
# get conferences

# get 2018 players

# add conferences to 2018 players wiht a left merge on teams


# get 2019 players

# add conference

# inner merge the two tables and add suffixes to conference

# subset the dataframe with only rows where 18 & 19 conference are diff
```
