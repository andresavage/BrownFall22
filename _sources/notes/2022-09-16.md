# Iterables and Indexing

## Logistics


### Assignment
On Assignment 2, there's a script to run to prepare it for grading.

````{important}
I missed a file in the template, so please create a file called requirements.txt that has the following contents.
```
jupyter-book
pyppeteer
pandas
jupytext
```
````

Correct script file (for .githu/workflows/submit.yml)

```
name: Prepare and Submit
on:
  workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  generatereport:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Install dependencies
    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    # install dependencies
    - name: dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    # generate the report
    - name: Convert notebooks to md for reading
      run: |
        jupytext --to myst *.ipynb
        jupytext --to myst */*.ipynb

    # compile the pdf
    - name: Build a basic html to pdf
      run: |
        jupyter-book build *.ipynb --builder pdfhtml

    # start a pull request for it
    - name: Create Pull Request
      uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4
      with:
        commit-message: 'convert to md'
        draft: false
        branch: published
        base: main
        title: Submission
```

Add this to `.gitignore`

```
_build/
```

### Grade Tracking

````{margin}
```{note}
Are these scribe screenshots helpful? do you want more of them?
```
````



Create a Project board

<iframe src="https://scribehow.com/embed/create_a_private_project__nUx_RZSATA6ZfNJsrzO22g" width="640" height="640" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>


Then [create your repo](https://classroom.github.com/a/1jyhkSZP) and  run the manual workflow on that actions tab to create issues:

## Lists of lists

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

Recall how indexing works with negagive numbers
```{code-cell} ipython3
topics = ['what is data science', 'jupyter', 'conditional','functions', 'lists', 'dictionaries','pandas' ]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
topics[-1]
```

A list we built together:

```{code-cell} ipython3

# You can remain anonymous (this page & the notes will be fully public)
# by attributing it to a celebrity or psuedonym, but include *some* sort of attribution
sentence_list = [
"The class is just starting to feel settled for me. - Dr. Brown",
"",
"Hello, I like sushi! - ",
"Why squared  aka the mask - is a computer science student."
"Data science is fun",
"Hello my fellow gaymers - Sun Tzu",
"Soccer is a sport -Obama",
"Hello, I love pizza - Bear",
"This class is CSC/DSP 310. - Student",
"It is 2:21pm -",
"Pizza conquers all- Beetlejuice"
"",
"ayyy whaddup wit it - frankie",
"This is a sentence - George W Bush",
"Steam is the best place to play videogames change my mind. - Todd Howard",
"This is a hello -",
"Hello how are you -",
"The monkey likes bananas. - A banana",
"",
"Just type a random sentence - Rosa Parks",
"",
"I love CSC. - Everyone",
"",
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog - Brendan Chadwick",
"I like computers - David",
"",
"The fitness gram pacer test is a multi aerobic capacity test - Matt 3",
"Sally sells seashells by the seashore. - Narrator",
"I would like to take a nap. - Tom Cruise,"
]
```


We can confirm this is a list
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(sentence_list)
```


We can use a list comprehension to remove the empty ones.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentences_clean = [s for s in sentence_list if len(s)>1]
sentences_clean
```

We can use the `split` method on a string to make a list of lists
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_data = [s.split('-') for s in sentences_clean]
sentence_data
```

then we can use the [DataFrame Constructor](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html))
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df = pd.DataFrame(data= sentence_data, columns=['sentence','attribution'])
```

We can use head by default for 5
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.head()
```

or pass a nubmer to get a different  number of rows
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.head(3)
```

the `loc` property can index on rows or columns, but is rows by deault
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.loc[3]
```

We can select a range, like in base python with a colon
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.loc[3:5]
```

## Loading a json

We can load a json using the `read_json` method the same way we used the `read_csv`
```{code-cell} ipython3
rhodyprog4ds_gh_events_url = 'https://api.github.com/orgs/rhodyprog4ds/events'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_json(rhodyprog4ds_gh_events_url)
```

## Working with your repo offline

```{warning}
This was not done in class and is optional
```


### Authenticate on Mac
On macOS install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

```
gh auth login
```

use defualts and choose to log in via browser.


### Authenticate on Windows
On winows install [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

Then try to do the clone step and GitBash will help you authenticate



### Work offline
Get your repo URL:

<iframe src="https://scribehow.com/embed/Get_your_repo_URP__83HK6IIFQGyZ63s3rED-hw" width="640" height="640" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

`cd` to where you want to save
```bash
cd prog4ds
git clone https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/02-loading-data-brownsarahm.git
```


work in the new folder that creates

When you want to Save

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'describe the work you did'
git push
```



## Questions After Class



### Logistics

#### where do we find the grading page?

<iframe src="https://scribehow.com/embed/Find_your_grade_tracking_project_board__jH1mXUbhQFakUXBZuuk6iw" width="640" height="640" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Assignemnt

#### what are the keys needed on the dictionaries for the assignment?
See the `datasets.py` file in the template repo

#### do we have to accept assignment 2 anywhere and if so how

Yes on the assignment page. The link says "accept the assignment"

#### For the purposes of the assignment should we download it locally to work with our notebooks?

Read the instructions carefully on the assignment. It tells you exactly what to do.


### Content

#### How do you locate a specific row and column from a dataframe?

`.loc` accepts both, using a comma to separate. The [docs for `loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html) have lots of examples.

#### with data sets if there is an error with formatting and we can modify the original how would we fix it

Download to a copy where you can edit.

#### Can you use .loc to pull out multiple rows that aren't next to each other. For example, if I wanted to view rows 3, 8 and 12

Yes, to select multiple nonconsecutive, you pass a list. The [docs for `loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html) have lots of examples.

#### how can we iterate through dictionaries

dictionaries have a `.items()` method that pops off tuples of th key and value.  

```{warning}
the assignment does not ask you to iterate through a dictionary object, but over a list of dictionaries
```

#### What is the main differnce between JSON and csv files; does one allocate more memory / store larger sets?

The main difference is the structure.  JSON can hold nested data.  For example look at the GitHub data that we read in in class.

#### what exactly does json mean / do

[json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is a data file format. It is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation.  It's a popular format for internet content.

#### are nested lists the only way to create DataFrames in python

nested lists are not the only way to create pandas DataFrames, you can also do that from a Dictionary. [see in the docs for the constructor](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).  

#### How do nested loops work in the jupyter notebook

Python constructs other than display items work just as they do in any other interpretter in a jupyter notebook.  The list comprehension that we saw today also works in base Python.  You can nest list comphrehenions in different ways depending on your goal.
