# Data Science and Course Logistics

## Course Logistics


Class is designed to avoid this:

## Check your understaning of the syllabus

It's easy when reading something long to lose track of it. Your eyes can go over each word, without actually retaining the information, but it's important to understand the syllabus for the course.

You can find the answers to the following questions on the syllabus. If you've already read it, try answering them to check your understanding. If you haven't read it yet, use these to guide you to get familiar with finding key facts about the course on the syllabus.

1. What do you need to bring to class each day?
1. What is the basis of grading for this course?
1. How do you reference the course text?
1. What is the penalty for missing an assignment?


More information about the course is available throughout the site, the next few questions will help you self-check that you've found the important things.  Remember, the goal is not necessarily to memorize all of this, but to be able to find it.

1. When & what are you expected to read for this class?
- [ ] read the text book before class
- [ ] review notes & documentation after class
- [ ] preview the notes  & documentation before class
- [ ] read documentation and text book after class
1. Your assignment says to find a dataset that has variables of a specific type, which website can you use?
1. Your assignment says to find a dataset of any type about something you're interested in, which resource would you use?




## What is Data Science?

Data Science is the combination of
![venn diagram of CS, Stats, & domain expertise with DS at the center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/ds_venn.png)


**statistics** is the type of math we use to make sense of data.
Formally, a statistic is just a function of data.

**computer science** is so that we can manipulate visualize and automate the inferences we make.

**domain expertise** helps us have the intuition to know if what we did worked
right. A statistic must be interpreted in context; the relevant context determines
what they mean and which are valid.  The context will say whether automating something
is safe or not, it can help us tell whether our code actually worked right or not.

### In this class,

![venn diagram of CS, Stats, & domain expertise with DS at the center, w/310 location marked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/310_venn.png)

We'll focus on the programming as our main means of studying data science, but we will
use bits of the other parts.  In particular, you're encouraged to choose datasets that you
have domain expertise about, or that you want to learn about.

But there are many definitions.  We'll use this one, but you may come across others.

### How does data science happen?

The most common way to think about what doing data science means is to think of this pipeline.  It is in the perspective of the data, these are all of the things that happen to the data.

![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process.png)

Another way to think about it

![DS process: 3 major phases (prepare,build,finish) with many sub-phases. Prepare:set goals, explore, wrangle, assess; Build: Plan, analyze, engineer, optimize, execute; Finish: Deliver, revise, wrap up](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/godsey/Figures/01fig02_alt.jpg)

### how we'll cover Data Science, in depth


![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process_course.png)

- *collect*: Discuss only a little; Minimal programming involved
- *clean*: Cover the main programming techniques; Some requires domain knowledge beyond scope of course
- *explore*: Cover the main programming techniques; Some requires domain knowledge beyond scope of course
- *model*:Cover the main programming, basic idea of models; How to use models, not how learning algorithms work
- *deploy*: A little bit at the end, but a lot of preparation for decision making around deployment


### how we'll cover it in, time

![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process_course_time.png)

We'll cover exploratory data analysis before cleaning because those tools will help us check how we've cleaned the data.
