    "**statistics** is the type of math we use to make sense of data.\n",
    "Formally, a statistic is just a function of data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**domain expertise** helps us have the intuition to know if what we did worked\n",
    "right. A statistic must be interpreted in context; the relevant context determines\n",

    "We'll focus on the programming as our main means of studying data science, but we will\n",
    "use bits of the other parts.  In particular, you're encouraged to choose datasets that you\n",
    "have domain expertise about, or that you want to learn about.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are many definitions.  We'll use this one, but you may come across others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does data science happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to think about what doing data science means is to think of this pipeline.  It is in the perspective of the data, these are all of the things that happen to the data.\n",
