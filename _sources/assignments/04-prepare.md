Eligible skills:
- prepare

- visualize
- access

```{warning}
The accept link will go live on Friday, there was an issue with the template, but you can work on the first and last parts now
```

## Check the Datasets you have worked with already

In the datasets you have used in your past assignments identify at least one
thing you could not do because the data was not in an appropriate format.

Apply one fix and show one summary statistic or plot to show that it works.


Some examples:
- a column that was a list
- missing values
- a column that was continuous, but more interesting as a categorical
- too many header rows

```{amdonition} Think Ahead

_this box is not required, but ideas for portfolio_
cleaning a dataset to make it able to answer questions that were not possible could satisfy the level 3 prepare requirements.
```


## Clean example datasets

There are datasets in the template repo for the assignment with a notebooks in the template have instructions for how to work with each dataset.

To earn prepare level 2, clean the data and do just enough exploratory data analysis to show that the data is usable (eg 1 stat and/or plot).

For prepare level 2: the dataset of your choice

To earn python level 2: clean the CS degrees dataset (use a function or lambda AND loop or comprehension)

For access level 2: clean the airline data (to get data in a second file type).

To earn summarize and visualize level 2: add extra exploratory data analyses meeting the criteria from the checklist (eg follow a3 checklists).

```{hint}
renaming thing is often done well with a dictionary comprehension or lambda.
```

## Study Cleaned Datasets

Read example data cleaning notes or scripts. To do this find at least one dataset for which the messy version, clean version, and a script or notes about how it was cleaned are available, answer the following questions. (some are added to the course website)

1. What are 3 common problems to look for in a dataset?
1. For a specific of your choice give an example of a question that would require making different choices than were made. Include a bit about the data, what was done, the question, what would need to be done instead and justification.
1. Explain in your own words, with a concrete example, how domain expertise can help you when cleaning data. Use either a made up example or one that you read about.
